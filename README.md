# Welcome to the [Progenetix documentation pages](http://info.progenetix.org)

The Progenetix code repository contains projects related to the [Progenetix](http://progenetix.org) and [arrayMap](http://arraymap.org) genome resources, such as data conversion scripts, ontology mappings and code for the [Beacon+](http://beacon.progenetix.org) project.

The source files for the web pages are in the [*pages*](./pages) directory.

## Core Documentation now at [docs.progenetix.org](http://docs.progenetix.org)

Due to the accumulation of too many separate pages and legacy documentation, in January 2022 we started a refactoring of the relevant Progenetix documentation into a [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) project.

The source files of the new/additional documentation are still part of this repository, contained in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory. Over time we will move most of the documentation to the new system and keep the [info pages](http://info.progenetix.org) for news and announcements.
