Progenetix Cancer Genomics Resource Documentation
=================================================

The Progenetix database and cancer genomic information resource  contains genome profiles of more than 100â€™000 individual cancer genome screening experiments. The genomic profiling data was derived from array and chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) experiments as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS, WES) studies. Genomic profiles are either processed from various raw data formats or are extracted from published experimental results.
