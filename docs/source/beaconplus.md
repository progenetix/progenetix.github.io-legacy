# Beacon - Discovery Services for Genomic Data

![Beacon logo](http://info.progenetix.org/assets/img/logo_beacon.png){: style="float: right; max-width: 25px; margin-bottom: -40px;"}The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery,
developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. Since 2016,
the Beacon protocols is being developed through the
[ELIXIR Beacon project](https://beacon-project.io) as a GA4GH driver project.

As part of the project, since early 2016 the [Computational Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics Group](http://info.baudisgroup.org) at the University of Zurich develops the
[Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> demonstrator](https://beacon.progenetix.org/ui/),
to demonstrate current functionality and future Beacon protocol extensions.

The Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> implementation is a
custom front end on top of the [Progenetix](https://progenetix.org)
dataset, with emphasis on structural genome variations from cancer samples.

On 2020-01-20,  Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> became part
of the [ELIXIR Beacon Network](https://beacon-network.elixir-europe.org).
