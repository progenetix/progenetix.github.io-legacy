## {{ page.title }}

The [Progenetix website](http:progenetix.org) has been completely rebuilt using
a JavaScript / React based framework and API based content delivery. At its core,
the site is built around the [Beacon](http://beacon-project.io) standard, with
some extensions for data colections and advanced query options.
