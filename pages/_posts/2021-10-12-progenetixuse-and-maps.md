#### [`progenetixuse`](https://progenetix.org/publications/progenetixuse/) Page

We have introduced a new publications listing page which contains links to articles
that [cite or use Progenetix](https://progenetix.org/publications/progenetixuse/) and
resources from this "ecosystem." Please [let us know](mailto:contact@progenetix.org)
if you are aware of other such cases - frequently the publications do not use
a proper citation format but just refer to "according tho the Progenetix resource"
or similar in the text.

For proper citation please follow [these instructions](https://info.progenetix.org/citation.html).

#### Improved Map

The pop-up in th Publication maps has been updated with a proper short text listing
and direct links to the article pages on EuropePMC.
