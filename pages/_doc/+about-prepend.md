The __Progenetix__ database and cancer genomic information resource was publicly launched in 2001, abnnounced through an article in [_Bioinformatics_](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/12/1228/225653). The resource currently contains genome profiles of more than 100'000 individual cancer genome screening experiments. The genomic profiling data was derived from genomic arrays and chromosomal [Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization) experiments as well as Whole Genome or Whole Exome Sequencing (WGS, WES) studies. Genomic profiles are either processed from various raw data formats or are extracted from published experimental results.

### Access, Maintenance and Contributions

The content of the progenetix resource is freely accessible for research and commercial purposes, with attribution.

The database &amp; software are developed by the [group of Michael Baudis](https://info.baudisgroup.org) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.mls.uzh.ch/en/research/baudis/) and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics [(SIB)]http://sib.swiss/baudis-michael/".

Many previous members and external collaborators have contributed to data content and resource features. Participation (features, data, comments) by volunteers are welcome.

While we try to respond to emails in a timely manner, for requests regarding interface improvements, new use case scenarios or bug reporting we recommend to use the Github issue trackers of the [**progenetix-web**](https://github.com/progenetix/progenetix-web/issues) web frontend.
