## {{ page.title }}

The `ontologymaps` service provides equivalency mapping between ICD-O and other
classification systems, notably NCIt. The mappings are represented in the [ICDOntologies](https://github.com/progenetix/ICDOntologies) project and accessible trough a front-end in the [Progenetix Services area](https://progenetix.org/service-collection/ontologymaps).

### ICD-O Representation

Our resources use an internal representation of ICD-O 3 codes since no official CURIES are provided by the IARC. The syntax is:

* ICD-O 3 morphologies
  - "icdom-"`s/\///`; i.e. number only code
  - "8500/3" => "icdom-85003"
* ICD-O 3 Topographies
  - "icdot-" + code
  - "C53.9" => "icdot-C53.9"  

#### Parameters

##### `filters`

* required
* comma-concatenated __complete__ codes and/or prefixes
* partial codes (see above for ICD-O syntax) will not be matched unless a relaxed filter precision is indicated

##### `filterPrecision`

* optional
* to allow partial code matches (see examples below)

#### Examples

##### NCIt and ICD-O 3

* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=icdom-85003>
* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=NCIT>
* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=icdom-85003,icdot-C50.9>
* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=icdom-85,icdot-C50&filterPrecision=start>
  - As in the example above, but by stemmming the query parameters and providing the `filterPrecision=start` pragma, the response will now be a list of matched data objects (inputs and equivalents)

##### UBERON and ICD-O 3 Topography

* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=UBERON>
  - all mappings
* <https://progenetix.org/services/ontologymaps/?filters=UBERON,icdot-C0&filterPrecision=start>
  - all `C0...` ICD-O T matches
  - limited to `UBERON` mappings since the prefix was given, too (otherwise all the NCIT mappings would also be listed for these ICD-O T code matches)
