## Browser Compatibility

Pages are created dynamically and mostly are being served as XML. Some browsers have problems with the XHTML/XML doctype. For older browsers, all pages are served as HTML, which on the other hand breaks SVG compatibility.

Working browsers for all features are (oldest compatible versions listed):


* Safari 3
* Safari iOS
* Firefox 3
* Google Chrome
* Internet Explorer 9

<p>Most other recent browsers (Opera etc.) should be fine, too, but haven't been tested. The basic requirements for full display are:</p>

<ul>
<li>inline SVG (but possibly can be achieved with plug-in)</li>
<li>HTML5 canvas support</li>
</ul>
