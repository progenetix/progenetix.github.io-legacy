## {{ page.title }}

The Progenetix site slowly transitions away from the legacy interface, with the aim to provide more functionality through an open [API](/tags/API.html) as well as frontend pages implemented through this (Markdown, Jekyll...) based documentation system.

Some early examples:

* [embedded map page](/pubmap.html)
* [CNV segments upload](/uploader.html) for users' data visualisation

These and upcoming pages can also be accessed through the ["Data Pages"](/categories/pages.html) category.
