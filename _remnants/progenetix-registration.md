## {{ page.title }}

As of March 2012, no specific registration is required for using the Progenetix and and arrayMap resources. However, we suggest that you contact [Michael Baudis](https://info.baudisgroup.org/group/Michael_Baudis/) if you plan any commercial use of the database or are interested to incorporate the data into your research projects.
