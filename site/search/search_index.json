Since 2016, the Beacon protocols is being developed through the ELIXIR Beacon project as a GA4GH driver project. As part of the project, since early 2016 the Computational Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics Group at the University of Zurich develops the Beacon + demonstrator , to demonstrate current functionality and future Beacon protocol extensions. The Beacon + implementation is a custom front end on top of the Progenetix dataset, with emphasis on structural genome variations from cancer samples. On 2020-01-20, Beacon + became part of the ELIXIR Beacon Network . BeaconPlus Data / Query Model The Progenetix / Beaconplus query model utilises the GA4GH core data model for genomic and (biomedical, procedural) queries and data delivery. The GA4GH data model for genomics recommends the use of a principle object hierarchy, consisting of variant (a.k.a. genomicVariation ) a single molecular observation, e.g. a genomic variant observed in the analysis of the DNA from a biosample mostly corresponding to the \"allele\" concept, but with alternate use similar to that in VCF (e.g. CNV are no typical \"allelic variants\") in Progenetix identical variants from different sampleas are identified through a compact digest ( variantInternalId ) and can be used to retrieve those distinct variants (c.f. \"line in VCF\") callset the entirety of all variants, observed in a single experiment on a single sample a callset can be compared to a data column in a VCF variant annotation file callset has an optional position in the object hierarchy, since variants describe biological observations in a biosample biosample a reference to a physical biological specimen on which analyses are performed individual in a typical use a human subject from which the biosample(s) was/were extracted In the Progenetix backend we mirror the GA4GH data model in the storage system, consisting of the corresponding variants callsets (analyses) biosamples individuals collections of MongoDB databases. These collections are addressed by scoped queries. filters Filters / Filtering Terms Filters represent a way to allow the resource provider to direct \"self-scoped\" query values to the corresponding attributes in their backend resource. In the Progenetix implementation, a lookup table followed by scope assignment is used to map prefixed filter values to the correct attributes and collections. Most of the filter options are based on ontology terms or identifiers in CURIE format (e.g. NCIT:C4033 , cellosaurus:CVCL_0030 or PMID:16004614 ). For use case examples please look below; documentation of available ontologies and how to find out about available terms can be found on the Classifications and Ontologies page. In Beacon v2, the new FilteringTerms schema adds options to specify different types of filters ( OntologyFilter , AlphanumericFilter , CustomFilter ) which can contain a number of parameters to define e.g. scope or matching behaviour. These more complex terms are only available through PUT requests. Example \"filters\": [ { \"id\": \"NCIT:C4536\", \"scope\": \"biosamples\", \"includeDescendantTerms\": false } ], Hierarchical Terminologies in Filter Queries Hierarchical terminologies allow queries at different levels, to include all its children terms. The Progenetix query filter system adopts this inclusion logic if the classification / code type is hierarchy-based. However, the includeDescendantTerms pragma can be used to modify this behaviour - globally if provided in a GET request ( &includeDescendantTerms=false ) or as part of filter objects (see above). Examples for codes with hierarchical treatment within the filter space are: NCIt true, deep hierarchical ontology of cancer classifications Cellosaurus derived cell lines are also accessible through the code of their parental line Beacon API Beacon v2: Path Examples in Progenetix The Beacon v2 protocol uses a REST path structure for consistant data access.

As the name implies, SVG is scalable , i.e. images can be scaled up without loosing quality or expanding in storage size. However, some of teh generated images use also embedded rastered components which will deteriorate during scaling - this is e.g. the case for array probe plots. {admonition} [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) All major modern web browsers\u2014including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge\u2014have SVG rendering support. On most pages where plots are being displayed there is a download option for the images - (please alert us where those are missing). Browsers also have the option to export SVGs themselves e.g. as PDF. The PGX plotting library Plots on Progenetix are generated using the PGX package , a set of Perl libraries for processing and graphical representation of CNV data. The package contains tools to read and write e.g. Progentix segment files generate binned status maps render plots of sample-specific and aggregate CNV data, such as histograms and CNV frequency heatmaps Services Cancer Genomics Publications publications The publications service serves as backend API for the display of genome screening publications through the Progenetix Publications DB . It provides articles describing whole genome screening (WGS, WES, aCGH, cCGH) experiments in cancer, including some information about e.g. the numbers of samples analysed with a given technology and if sample profiles are available in Progenetix. Please contact us to alert us about additional articles you are aware of. The inclusion criteria are described in the documentation . Since 2021 you can now directly submit suggestions for matching publications to the oncopubs repository on Github .

Traditionally, the relevance of somatic CNVs hitting a gene in the context of cancer are judged by the CNV frequency (i.e. in what fraction of samples the a CNV in this gene is being observed) the relative specificity, i.e. how CNVs in this gene compare to the overall amount of CNVs in the samples the local specificity, i.e. the \"focality\" of the CNVs The Progenetix Search Page supports the exploration of regional CNVs through support for inserting positions of genes or cytobands into standard Beacon query parameter fields selection support for hierarchical disease annotations providing example queries as templates The response of the queries for genomic variants provide some basic statistics, e.g. the relative frequencies of these variants for each classification code (e.g. NCIT, ICD-O) encountered in teh matched samples. Example Procedure TBD Download or Plot CNV Frequencies The Progenetix resource provides pre-computed CNV frequencies for all its \"collations\" such as cancer types by e.g. NCIt, ICD-O morphology and topography codes experimental series, e.g. all samples from a given publication custom cohorts, e.g. all samples used in a Progenetix meta-analysis or external project such as TCGA This data can be accessed through the Progenetix API in data and image format. Interval frequencies are per default stored in a 1Mb binned format. More information about the API use can be found in the IntervalFrequencies API documentation . Example Procedure - Download CNV Frequencies Typical cases for the use of collation-specific frequency data could be e.g. the visualization of CNV tracks with 3rd party tools such as Circos or integration in data analysis workflows, e.g. for comparing target genes to local, disease-specific CNV frequencies.
